# X-Press Publishing

## Project Overview

In this project, I have built an internal tool for a comic book publishing company called X-Press Publishing.

The X-Press Publishing internal tool should allow users to:
- Create, view, and update artists
- Create, view, update, and delete comic book series
- Create, view, update, and delete issues of a specific comic book series
